## Exercises

Exercises are separated by directory in `src/##`. Each directory should contain a `README.md` describing the goal of the exercise, as well as tips and comments in the files to help you along.

Your objective is to accomplish the goals in `README.md`. If you get stuck, refer to the `.final.js` files in each directory.

This is to get you comfortable writing state machines so ideally pair up and  have fun!
