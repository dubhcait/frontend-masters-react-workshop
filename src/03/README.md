# Exercise 03 - Parameterizing Actions

In this exercise, we're going to use `context` to hold extended state (state that isn't finite) and `assign(...)` to update `context` in an action.

## Goals

- Use context to hold your and your opponents pokemon
- add a state to switch pokemon
- Update them to different pokemon with `assign(...)`
