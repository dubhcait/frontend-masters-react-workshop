# Exercise 05 - More machines???

You can take this to the next level and decide the battle outcome soo lets spawn a machine for that. Start with you always wining for plot armour. Once you've got that down lets move to something more logical like depending of pokemon type?

## Goals

- `Spawn` a state machine to dictate the outcome of the battle
- Experiment, there are a huge amount of features in xstate so have a think about what you would like to do and see if there is any feature in xstate that could help you.
